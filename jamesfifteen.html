<h4> Chapter 15</h4><p>It was a difficult time of life for this misfortune to have overtaken James.  He was sixty-two years old.  He had six surviving children, none of whom was yet in a position to add to the family revenue, and most of whom were of school age or under.  These were, Clare, who had recently taken up the study of professional nursing, and was with the Sisters of Charity, Baltimore;  Josephine, Gerald, Monica and Richard, all still at school;  and finally Kathleen, as yet not of school age.  With such responsibilities, it would have unnerved many a strong man to have to face the problem of having to set up on his own.  But James, a deeply religious man, never failed in his faith that God would provide.  He had the great advantage of being well known and respected in Cumberland, and so in due course began slowly to build up a private practice.  It was a hard struggle, and so it came as a great relief when in 1912 he was appointed City Engineer to the city of Cumberland.</p><p>Although now back on a salaried job all was not vet well with James.  For although his professional qualifications were unimpeachable, he was the possessor of one characteristic which, in view of some of the city fathers of those days, was not only an unnecessary, but even an undesirable characteristic.  This was the characteristic of integrity.  Shortly before he had been appointed, the City Council had voted a half a million bond issue for the construction of a new water supply for the city.  They had employed an 'eminent' New York engineer to have entire charge of the engineering and construction work.  This eminent man employed inexperienced men on the job, and failed to supervise the work as he should have done.  When James inspected progress on the work and afterwards reported his dissatisfaction with it to the City Council, he was told that it was none of his business.</p><p>But his charter as City Engineer made him responsible for approving the monthly estimates before payment.  James had the last say and would not pass them until he was satisfied.  The discovery of an error of five thousand dollars, previously passed as correct by a predecessor, which James insisted on having deducted from the next estimate, opened the eyes of the Council, so that James' exposure of graft and the stand he had made was made an issue at the next election for City Commissioners.  Fortunately James' friends were returned to office and he was re-elected city engineer for another two years.  He left the employment of the City in 1916.  James died in Cumberland in 1917.  Only five of his children survived him to comfort his wife Agnes in her loss, for to the great grief of those devoted parents, their son Gerald had died in 1910, in his sixteenth year.  Agnes survived her husband for another sixteen years and died in 1933.</p>
<p class="inset">As an added postscript: On the date I close this revival of James' biographies, his youngest daughter, Kathleen Louise (Sister Monica Clare, CSC) is approaching her 99<sup>th</sup> birthday in the Holy Cross Convent, Notre Dame, Indiana. We have recently corresponded.</p><h5> John Burke-Gaffney (1921)<br /> Nanaimo,B.C.<br /> October 14, 2001</h5>
