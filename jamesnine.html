<!--<h4> Chapter 9 </h4> -->
<p>John after his retirement from the Indian Service lived on the Isle of Jersey. He and Jessie are now living in Ireland, at the time I write (January 26, I907).  Were it not for his wonderful affection, if I may not use the stronger expression, love. for his brother Tom, I fear he would not care to live in Ireland, the climate being too damp for him. Their life long love I believe is rarely found between brothers.  They have corresponded regularly with each other, weekly, for over forty years!  </p><p>Next in succession was poor Edward – our mothers darling as we always called him. I do not well recollect, but I believe he was rather a delicate child, and had to wear heavy flannels, seldom worn by the children in Ireland. He grew up, however to vigorous manhood, was the tallest of all the boys~ over six feet, and was fuller of fun and spirit than any of my brothers. Like my Father he was fond of all manly ports, athletics, hunting and fishing. He took a trip to America with some friends, merely intended as a short visit, but remained in New York for a few years, when he married a Miss Laura Andrews who was only about seventeen years old when they were married, and died within a year of his marriage, having a little son, Edward, who lived only about twelve months. This child was born about two months after my arrival in America. I was his godfather. After Edward's death in July 1871, I felt as if this child were my own and loved it dearly;  it was a blow only second to that of the death of his father when he too died. I was dearly attached to Laura, but as she married greatly to my sorrow within a year after her husband's death, I ceased all intimacy with her and she dropped as completely out of my life as if I had never known her. Her second husbands name was Brown, and I am under the impression he was arrested not long after his marriage for embezzlement. </p><p>Edward too, like John, had studied medicine but followed the drug business in preference to being a physician, although he did practice occasionally. He was surgeon of the 9th Regiment of the N.Y. National Guards at his death. He was a most lovable character and had hosts of friends. He was by far the best looking of all the boys. He is buried, with his baby beside him, in the family lot of the Madden's of Roundout, Ulster Co., New York.   M.J. Madden and Edward appeared as fond of each other as were my brother Tom and John heretofore referred to. This Mr. Madden and his good wife were the best friends I ever had, and I really loved them as if they were my own blood relatives. I hope I may be able to pay them greater tribute when I reach my own Memoirs. </p><p>Next comes my sister Helen. She is better known to my children than any of their aunts. She, Josephine and I were more intimately associated as a trio than the others of the family as we were the middle members, too young for the elder and too old for the younger ones. We studied together and they helped me along as they were so much brighter. I  owe all the best instincts of my nature to their care of me, and whatever little good there may be in me is due to their loving dispositions, and this comradeship continued until I became of age and started out in the world, and has been kept alive by a constant correspondence ever since. Helen had a taste for literature and art. After couple of years study in Augsburg, Bavaria, she returned but to enter a convent at Rathfarnham near Dublin in the Order of Loretta. She has spent some years in English and Irish houses of this Order, and is now in the Coleja de la B.V.F. at Zala, Viscaya, Spain, after having spent several years in Gibraltar and their convent, Castellyn de la Cuesta, Seville, Spain. She has kept up her literary tastes, and occasionally writes little stories for magazines under the pen name of "Elizabeth" which is also her name in religion. </p><p>There is little more to be said of the life of a religious, unless she may be an exception to most of those who renounce the world - she has never seemed to have lost love of her kindred and takes the strongest interest in their lives – particularly so in my life I believe, as I always have been obliged at her solicitation to enter very fully into the details of any work I might be engaged in, notably in any of great interest: such as, tunnels or bridges – in the last tunnels I constructed on the George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad.  </p>
