<h4> Chapter 10</h4><p>For these she sent me a little form of prayer she wished me to repeat every day I inspected the progress of the work, which I did faithfully, she promising to repeat the same every day herself for my success. We never have had a man even seriously hurt during the building of these tunnels, and as the borings of one of these tunnels became close together, the centers I gave in each breast were bored through and together, and the drills met point to point as if in one hole. This was exceptionally good luck, and may be attributed to her good prayers when it is considered that the grade from the Upper portal was descending 2% and the grade from the lower portal ascending also 2%. Up to the time I left the service of the Georges Creek and Cumberland Railroad Co. I believe I never rode through these tunnels without repeating this prayer.  I may say here I have had singular good fortune in never having a man even seriously injured on any works I have had charge of and I feel that this may be attributed to the pious prayers of good sisters Helen and Josephine, in religion known as Elizabeth and Columba. </p><p>And this naturally brings me to the latter, Josephine, although I was born between these two sisters I will leave myself to the last. Josephine was the sweetest of sisters a brother could desire. While Helen was equally affectionate in a different manner, and being older than I, Josephine was more demonstrative and looked upon me as older brother and superior to her in strength as in her younger days was as fond of outdoor sport as we boys. She could and would play cricket with the best of us -- this is somewhat like our American Base Ball. Withall she was refined and ladylike in every and her influence had much to do with keeping down the savage instincts inherent in boys. Her influence on me I feel has followed me through life in attracting me to what was pure and womanly -- and deterring me from anything that was contrary to these virtues. although so full of life and its innocent pleasures, she was of a very pious nature and in her early years, not yet more than fifteen or sixteen, it was she that set the time for the nightly rosary. If from unexplained cause this devotion was delayed a little later than usual, and being sleepy, I might try to steal off bed, her watchful eye would detect me, and without any delay, before I could reach the door knob, she would drop on her knees and begin to recite the prayers. Father, Mother and all would put down books or work, or even unfinished a game of whist, without a single remonstrance. In very shame I would also of course join in no matter how sleepy I might have at first felt. </p><p>So kind and gentle was she that I must relate one incident which has ever lingered in my memory -- one night as I was retiring to my room and passing by her door she came out half disrobed and clasped her arms around my neck asking me to forgive her for some imaginary unkindness during the day. I cannot remember at all what this slight offense was, be it great or little, her tears and love more than compensated me for the deed. She was very much admired by our male friends, but always seemed to care more for the society of her brothers than any of the young men.  Daniel 0'Connell, the grandson of the Great O'Connell, was an ardent admirer of hers, and had ample opportunity of showing his affection, as in return compliment of the kind attention paid my father by his grandfather fifty years previously.  Father used to send a carriage into Ballrnrobe every Saturday and return him in time for Monday morning opening of the bank of which he was cashier.  </p><p>I had no idea I would have spread myself into a second volume but my reminiscences grow as I dwell on them. </p><p>But to proceed with my sister Josephine, or Columba as she now  loves to be called. One very happy memory of her is in connection with our First Holy Communion.  We were prepared for this great event in our lives by the good sisters of the "Poor Claresas they were called, in their convent at Harrods Cross, Dublin. The good old Reverend Mother had me in her especial charge, and her dear kindly old face is as fresh in my memory now as it was forty-five years ago. </p>
