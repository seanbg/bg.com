      <h3>The Canadian Burke-Gaffneys</h3>
      <h5>by John Burke-Gaffney, third son. November, 2001</h5>
<h4>About Ted</h4>
<p>When the time came for Ted to attend high school, in 1929,
  he took his first year at St. Paul's College on Selkirk Ave., at the other
  end of the streetcar line.  The college had been founded by the Archdiocese,
  organized by Monsignor Morton, and run by the Oblate Order.  He spent
  his second year at Kelvin Technical High School on Stafford St. near Academy
  Road, presumably for its convenient location and public funding.  Ted
  soon taught his brothers the Kelvin cheer, &quot;KTHS, KTHS, are we with
  you, well, I guess!&quot;  He also picked up the nickname 'Tank' about
  this time, learned to play the ukulele and to build crystal radios.</p>
<p>The following year, he completed high school at Regina's
  Campion College, run by the Jesuits.  Mary remembers helping cut out the
  letters for a large sign hung in the living room saying, &quot;Welcome
  home, Ted.&quot;  In 1932 he entered St. Paul's College, then federated
  with the University of Manitoba, and pursued a course in science, with
  a particular interest in geology, as did his father before him.  In those
  days, U of M had a major campus in downtown Winnipeg on the Mall, in sight
  of the Legislative Buildings, but he attended some courses at the main
  campus in Fort Garry, then on the outskirts of the city.  When certain
  courses required them to attend Fort Garry, Ted and his fellow students
  would cram into a taxi and share the expense.</p>
<p>One summer, he and his close friend Gerry Twomey got jobs
  on a cattle boat to Britain.  They saw little of the ocean or of England
  as the smelly boat unloaded its cargo, turned around and headed back,
  docking in New York.  Ted took advantage of their location by visiting
  the James Gaffney family in Washington and nearby Virginia, his second
  cousins.  In all, they claimed it was an adventure.</p>
<p>When Ted completed university, he won a place on the Geological
  Survey of Canada which sent a party of 14 men to map the God's Lake country
  of northern Manitoba.  The advance crew of four, including Ted, left Winnipeg
  early in May on the <em>S.S. Keenora</em>, an old wood-fired steamship that
  plied Lake Winnipeg.  John remembers accompanying his father to Selkirk
  to meet the <em>S.S. Keenora</em> late that fall.  Ted stepped off the boat
  wearing a full beard, moccasins and redolent of wood smoke.  He must have
  seen his future on the Pre-Cambrian Shield.</p>
<p>Ted's work in northern Manitoba led him to Helen Ganz, a
  nurse, whom he met at Sherridon, Man., and married at The Pas July 7,
  1941, the same year he joined Sherritt-Gordon Mines, as a geologist. 
  Dad and Mother became grandparents in 1942 when Ted and Helen had their
  first child, Mary Helen, in Sherridon.  Within a month, Ted transferred
  to the Josephine Iron Mine in Ontario and Helen followed shortly afterward. 
  Josephine had no hospital, so Helen returned to The Pas to have John Patrick
  in 1944.</p>
<p>(<em>Background</em>:  The 20-year-old mine in Sherridon began
  to run out about this time and the company sent Ted to the Josephine Iron
  Mine in Ontario as one of several geologists sent throughout the region
  in an effort to locate a new ore body.  By 1945 Sherritt had laid claim
  to one of the world's richest nickel strikes at a totally isolated area
  120 miles north of Sherridon at Lynn Lake. To reach Lynn Lake the company
  built a treacherous ice road over the muskeg that took 75 hours to travel. 
  Although the town planners allocated areas for houses, streets, churches,
  an arena and a clubhouse, the company decided instead to haul the town
  of Sherridon piece by piece on skids over the winter road.  The president
  of Sherritt-Gordon said at the time, "Sherridon won't become a ghost town;
  we'll take the ghost with us."  The transfer was completed in 1953.)</p>
<p>Helen had returned to The Pas in 1946 to bury her father
  when the company ordered Ted to Lynn Lake;  Ted, in Josephine, packed
  all their belongings and sent them back to Sherridon where Helen and the
  two infants stayed until accommodation became available – their new home
  in the winter of 1945-46 was a 12x28 wooden box with no electricity, gasoline
  lamps for light and wood for the stove.  Ted was appointed manager of
  labour relations, a daunting job in a community of roughnecks. After two
  years, Helen returned to Sherridon to wait for their 'real' house to be
  relocated north.  The next two children, Frances Maureen (1948) and Thomas
  Edward (1949) were born in Sherridon.  Finally, in 1952, the family returned
  to Lynn Lake where Theresa Anne (1953), Kathleen Margaret (1954) and Christopher
  James (1956) were born.  To quote Theresa, "Mom was elated to get oil
  heat, and an electric washer and dryer."</p>
<p>In 1958, Ted and Helen made the difficult decision to leave
  the north in exchange for better opportunities for their children.  They
  moved to Winnipeg where they found there were few calls for geologists; 
  Ted found employment in his cheerful way in several fields, mainly with
  a printing company and a concrete forming firm.  Helen, in turn, returned
  to nursing at the nearby Misericordia Hospital.  In due course the girls
  attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart to be taught by their Aunt Mary
  among other nuns. </p>
<p>Pat was the first to leave home, marrying Valerie Johnston
  in 1964; Maureen married Maurice Copiak in 1969 (forever afterwards known
  as Mo and Moe).  Mary, the eldest, slow to develop after difficulties
  at birth but greatly assisted by her family and Social Services, and gainfully
  employed, moved to her own apartment and in 1984 married Brian Rusk. Tom
  settled in The Pas and married Amanda Jane Moore in 1983. </p>
<p>Theresa and Kathleen, free spirits, saw the world together
  and separately until Theresa had a disastrous accident driving a mail
  truck from Thompson, Man., which left her paralyzed but indomitable. 
  Kathy took up a career as a carpenter/house builder out of Stuartburn,
  Man.  Chris became a rock musician and manager of award-winning talent,
  based in Winnipeg, where he had two sons, Nicholas and Jack.</p>
<p>About 1978, Ted and Helen moved to a high-rise apartment
  in downtown Winnipeg overlooking the Assiniboine River and the Legislative
  Buildings not far away.  Eventually, tired of the cold winters, Ted and
  Helen retired in 1986 to Victoria, B.C. and found a sunny apartment in
  the James Bay area.  They celebrated their 50<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary
  in 1991 at The Pas with their entire family around them.  Vancouver Island
  became a gathering place for family members: John and Isobel moved to
  Nanaimo in 1988, and Maurice, Maureen and Theresa in 1996 in Duncan bought
  a house with a spectacular view.  The three families celebrated birthdays
  and holidays together, especially in 1997 with a big house-warming and
  birthday party for Maureen, attended by Ted & Helen, John & Isobel,
  Frank & Lois from Calgary, Mary RSCJ from Montreal, plus Brian &
  Michiko from Japan with Taka & Saya, and Noel and children
  from Vancouver, the Copiak parents and friends.  An informal snapshot
  taken that day will appear here shortly.</p>
<p>Helen and Ted celebrated their 85<sup>th</sup> birthdays
  in March and July, 2000, surrounded by family and friends.  In February
  2001, Ted died in Victoria General Hospital after bowel surgery.  He was
  buried from St. Andrew's Church, Victoria, with all surviving members
  of his family in attendance.</p>
