<h4>patrick &amp; mary louise </h4>
      <p>There was quite a social life in Dublin for young girls:
        teas, tennis, boating, etc.  Dot, Goog and several of their friends used
        to play tennis on week-ends with young men from University College and
        Trinity College.  Iris Glenny relates her mother's (Dot) account of how
        Patrick met Mary Louise:  &quot;In 1908 the three Glenny brothers, Robert,
        Sidney and Percy, attending Trinity, had invited the Henebery sisters
        and their close friend Agnes Daly to one of the season's big tennis dances: 
        Dot and Bob, Goog and Sidney, Agnes and Percy were all going together. 
        At the last minute Sidney took sick and asked an acquaintance, Paddy Burke-Gaffney,
        to squire Goog – that was where it all started.&quot;</p>
      <p>Remembering her own mother's stories, Mary Burke-Gaffney,
        RSCJ, believes Mother met Jack first, when she frequented the National
        Bank where he worked, and knew the family through him.  However, Jack
        was about three years her junior and joined the bank in 1909, the year
        Robert Glenny left for Canada with a promise to send for Dot the next
        year.  The time-frame favors the tennis theorem.  In any case, they found
        a great deal in common.  Both liked music.  Mary says, &quot;I recall
        the joy with which Mother spoke of being invited by Dad to Victor Herbert
        operettas in seats 'up in the gods.'  Dad played the violin:  I remember
        only a few times his attempt to take it up again accompanied by Mother
        on the piano. He had lost his touch and regretted it.  Mother never lost
        her ability to play by ear and could easily take up current dance tunes.
        We used to ask her to play &quot;The Spinning Wheel,&quot; a showy piece,
        just to watch her hands speed across the keys.  I wonder what became of
        the violin and mandolin in their bedroom closet?&quot;</p>
      <p>A faded photograph in Patrick's collection marked 1911 10
        VI &quot;Howth&quot; shows a young woman formally dressed in overcoat
        and big hat.  It must be Mary Louise, especially when matched with another
        photo of a group of young men with surveyors' equipment -- clearly Patrick's
        engineering class -- is also captioned &quot;Howth 1911.&quot;  Paddy
        and his fellow students may have been doing field work around Howth. 
        A photograph of Thomas Burke-Gaffney and several family members, taken
        in 1913, shows Mary Louise seated in the centre, smiling.  Patrick doesn't
        appear in the picture, and since he had become a proficient photographer,
        he likely took the photograph of his fiancée to carry with him to Canada.</p>
      <h4>the canadian story</h4>
      <p>This chronicle begins when Patrick, newly graduated in 1912,
        having spent a term lecturing in mathematics at University College of
        Dublin, applies for a position in a Shannon River power project but places
        second.  Attending a reception early in 1913 for the successful candidate,
        he met an agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway which was searching for
        an engineer for projects based in North Transcona, Man.  The agent urged
        Patrick to apply, he did, was accepted, and left for Canada April 1913.</p>      <p>We believe he fully intended to complete the Transcona project
        as field work in preparation for doctoral study back home and probably
        a career in education.  He obviously was attracted by his prospects in
        Canada and by year's end had persuaded Mary Louise to join him.  He never
        returned to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Patrick arrived in Manitoba at a turning point in its history: 
        A map dated 1914 showed Manitoba's &quot;frontier of settlement&quot;
        at a line just above Gimli, about 50 miles north of Winnipeg, although
        Manitoba's border in 1912 had moved north to include Hudson Bay and a
        seaport.  Wheat dominated the economy.  Boosted as &quot;the Chicago of
        the North&quot;, Winnipeg had gone through a decade of overheated expansion
        in population and development.  North Transcona, his workplace, was little
        more than a major railway junction on the north-eastern limits of Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>Patrick's 1920 application to the new Association of Professional
        Engineers of Manitoba contains a valuable outline of his early engineering
        career:  his first CPR assignment from April to July 1913 he described
        as &quot;Rodman C.P.R., maintenance of way.&quot;  He was given an opportunity
        to appraise his new domain while examining the railway's properties. 
        In July his title changed to &quot;Instrumentman.&quot;  Then &quot;October
        1913 - March 1915 - Inspector C.P.R.&quot;  One might speculate that this
        position brought enough pay and stability that he could send for his fiancée.</p>
      <h4>marriage &amp; a new home</h4>
      <p>Mary Louise sailed from Bristol on the 25th of August 1914
        on board the 'King Edward' and arrived in Montreal on September 4 where
        Patrick met her, accompanied by Robert Glenny who had married her sister
        &quot;Dot&quot; in 1910 and resided in Montreal; by odd chance, the sisters
        weren't able to share the joy of the occasion -- Robert and Dot had returned
        to Ireland to visit their families earlier that summer, and she had stayed
        on to have an operation.  When she was ready to return, her ship was delayed
        by the outbreak of World War 1.  Because Mary Louise couldn't spend the
        night with two bachelors, they went directly from the ship to St. Patrick's
        Church (now Basilica) and were married with a witness from the street. 
        The newly wed couple spent their wedding night at the Glenny's downtown
        flat then caught the train the next morning for the long trip back to
        Winnipeg.  For a girl who had led a sequestered life, of which 10 had
        been spent boarding in a convent, the vast, unpopulated countryside she
        saw from the train must have been a revelation.  Harvesting would have
        been at its peak -- and, perhaps as a portent, Manitoba that year enjoyed
        the largest wheat crop in its history.</p>
      <p>They made their first home in a converted caboose, parked
        on a spur line close to Patrick's Transcona office in the CPR yard.  Among
        Patrick's photographs is a snapshot dated 1914;  on its back, Mary Louise
        had written affectionately &quot;Chez Burke-Gaffney.&quot;  It shows a
        narrow room, immaculately kept, with clusters of daisies on the dining
        table, on a bookcase and even on Patrick's big oak desk on the opposite
        wall.  There are tidy curtains, prints and photos on the walls, and the
        young bride is seated at the table, looking solemnly at the camera over
        her Irish linen tablecloth and a large Ironstone serving dish.  She had
        cause to be grave:  the Manitoba winter had set in.</p>
      <p>Years later, Mary Louise would regale her children with chilling
        stories about the several-mile walks that winter to reach the streetcar
        line to attend Mass in Winnipeg.  Another photograph shows a farmer and
        his wife in their wagon, wrapped in fur and scarves, their breath steaming,
        only their eyes and noses showing.  The Irish immigrants must have adapted
        quickly to local customs: she told the story of making her way alone to
        Winnipeg on a cold day wearing kid gloves and tightly-fastened leather
        boots which she exchanged for heavy mittens and felt boots bought at Eaton's.</p>
      <p>Still, the caboose had electricity and on-board water, with
        fresh milk delivered daily and fresh food not available in Ireland, including
        novelties such as bananas and corn.</p>
