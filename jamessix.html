<h4> Chapter 6</h4>
<p>This dear old soul was then in his declining years and was chaplain of a convent in Brooklyn where he died shortly afterwards. In the meantime we exchanged visits several times a week, and my dear brother was then living and I had to send many kind messages from one to the other every time I wrote home and received letters from there. How many mementos must not these good priests have offered for my grandfather and his family. My Mother I feel had a good share in their prayers. My Grandparents, Burke, are buried under the sacristy of the Church of Ballyhaurn's in the county of Mayo, in a vault closed by an iron door with steps leading down to it. </p><p>Now I hope to be more definite as to the immediate members of my family -- brothers, and sisters. Mary being the oldest must take precedence. She was considered very bright from her earliest childhood, being the first, of course, had received most attention. She was a pet of Daniel O'Connell, the Great Father Matthews, the Apostle of Temperance, the Patriot William Smith O'Brian, a brother-in-law of my father's by his first marriage - John Blake Dillon of "Young Irelander" fame a relative of my Mother's - and father of the present John Dillon, the Irish Nationalist - and many others of that bright circle of young men of the times. My father being in a high government position never took any active part in opposition to the Crown, as he always held he was a servant of the Kingdom of Ireland - as an Irishman loving his own country and serving her interest to the best of his ability. Never the less he was the friend indeed of many of these young patriots who loved their country if not wisely - certainly only but too well for their own personal interests. From our home John Dillon escaped to France disguised as a priest. It was nothing unusual to have priests visit our house, as I mentioned before, as so many had known my mother from her childhood and girlhood days. Dillon remained some days in the garb of the clergy, and was smuggled off from our summer home on the Island of Ross-beg in the harbour of Westport in a fishing boat across to France. </p><p>I can remember William Smith O'Brian, before referred to, after his return from Van Dieman's Island in far-off Australia where he had been exiled for the part he took in the little insurrection of 1848. On his return, he visited our home. Josephine, Walter and I were the youngsters then, when we were brought in, I suppose dressed in our best for the occasion. We had pockets in our dresses of which we were very proud. Father said they should have something put in them for good luck and accordingly put some pennies in Josephine's and Walter's pockets. Telling me to open mine he took a fire shovel –  they had been sitting around the hearth - and poured some ashes into my pockets. Tears filled my eyes with disappointment, and immediately, Uncle O'Brian, as we called him, took me on his lap, emptied the ashes out and put a handful of silver and pennies in greatly to my joy and complete satisfaction of the injury done my feelings previously, I am sure this memory of O'Brian fixed him indelibly my mind as otherwise I might have no recollection of him.</p><p>I have wandered off a long way from sister Mary.  She grew up a very talented young lady, accomplished in languages and music, especially. For a few years, to about her twenty-second year, she was in delicate health and it was feared she was threatened with consumption - so prevalent in Ireland then. She was sent to visit our relatives in the South of England for a while and returned in good health. She became engaged to brilliant young Irishmen who had spent a few years in America, and returning went to France where he became the private secretary of one of the great Rothschild Bankers of European fame. He was afterwards made manager one of their banks and became very wealthy.  Redmond Mannion was his name; he had only his mother and one sister, Marion.  His mother died during the period of their engagement in the Spring; their marriage was fixed for the latter part of October, and in the intervening summer Marion and Mary visited him in France, where they were entertained most hospitably by members of the Rothschild family.  Mannion died after a short illness of pneumonia early in October leaving his estate equally divided between his sister and fiance.  Marion soon followed him, and she left her half to Mary. </p>
