<h4> Chapter 4</h4><p>Before going more fully into the details of my brothers and sisters biographies I wish to mention something of my aunts and unc1es and something of their fami1ies. I remarked previously my father had but one brother James. He was an easy going country gent1eman with none of the life and energy of my father. He succeeded to his fathers estate, married late in life a lovely but delicate young wife, who died early leaving one son and three daughters, Uncle James did not survive her long and left his children to the care of his sisters Margaret and Ann, and well did these ladies fulfill their guardianship -- their piety induced their nephew Thomas to study for the priesthood, and he died only last September as Pastor of St. Peters Church, Rutland, Vermont, universally regretted by all of every denomination of his neighbors. He was a man of big heart and whole souled. One of his sisters, Annie, married William F. Taaffe, and these are the parents of our good cousins, Thomas Gaffney Taaffe and Rev. James Taaffe, S.J. who are both well and favorably known to my children. There are three other Taaffes: William, Joe, and Frank. Ji11iarn is married and has one child, a girl, at the time write.</p><p>My aunts Margaret and Anne Gaffney were very pious women who never married, but devoted their lives to acts of charity. They with others re-estab1ished the order of St. Francis in Ireland, and whi1e living in the world, observed the rules as strictly as if they were cloistered nuns. On the death of Aunt Margaret, the order erected a beautiful monument in Glasneven Cemetery, Dublin, to her memory as the foundress of the order. Aunt Ann followed her some years later and is buried at her side. Near by also lies the remains of my father and mother in the same cemetery -- a photograph of that monument my children have often seen:  a white marble cross with a wreath of flowers thrown gracefully over it. Two of Father Tom Gaffney's sisters never married -- one, Margaret, lives in New York, and the other, Catherine, in Ireland. My father had another sister, Catherine, who married a Mr. Mooney and had one son, Bernard -- but all of these are dead for some years and left no offspring to perpetuate their name. </p><p>On my Mother's side we have many relatives. She had two brothers, John and Joseph, and three sisters, Helen, Maria and Louise. Uncle John married Anastatia Burke, we always called her Aunt "Anstice". She had fourteen children. I cannot now remember all the names of the children of this union – of those I recall, John, the oldest, came to this country and settled near St. Paul, Minnesota, I believe. I have not heard if he ever married. Minnie, the eldest daughter, married a Mr. Garvey and came to this country and settled near St. Paul, Minnesota, I believe. I have not heard anything about her since. Joseph was the third. He was a queer genius who wrote poetry, but never was practical in anything. He, too, came to this country and occasionally visited Cousin Joe Burke of Alabama. He would come unannounced and would leave as unexpectedly, never saying where he went, where he proposed going. I can remember only James, Anne, and Brigid, who was called after my mother. The latter I believe is a governess in a French family. Uncle Joe Burke was a Doctor who married a Miss Louise Lynch. He died leaving four or five daughters. Aunt Louise and the children came to America and settled in Chicago. I visited them in 1876, but have since lost all knowledge of them. I tried to find them when I visited the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893 but could not learn anything about them. One of these girls married a German named Mohr. A second was married to an American whose name I cannot remember. All can recollect about her is that she was a strikingly handsome woman and lived some little distance from Chicago. </p>
