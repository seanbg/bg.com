<h4> Chapter 13</h4><p>I hear of him occasionally through Sister Columba who corresponds with his wife. I believe they have two very fine sons and one daughter. I do not know their names. These with Annie's children are nephews and nieces I may never know and my children may never know these cousins. </p><p>Next follows Louise, my youngest sister. I have not much to tell about her personally. She was about Monica's age now. when I saw her last, and of course she hardly recollects me in her early days. I have faithfully endeavoured to awaken a sisterly feeling for me in her heart by writing to her from time to time. She never replied to any of my calls for friendship -- a little over a year ago I wrote her on receiving photograph of her which my Rev. Cousin Father Tom Gaffney sent me merely to see and return to him. He said she was "the best and finest of all the Gaffneys".  I had an enlarged copy of this picture made before returning it to Father Gaffney, and on the strength of this made another attempt to open a correspondence with her but failed, as I learned from Columba -- to whom she sent my letter, saying she had no desire to correspond with me, she did not have any affection for me as a brother. That when she struggling to gain an independence, studying to become a trained nurse, I neglected her and gave her no help. This was a complete surprise " I never heard of any of these struggles, nor had she ever appealed for any assistance I would have been only too happy to share any means I had were I asked, as I did in Charles case, and on other occasions. So her silence toward me is based on diametrically contrary reasons than of Charles' silence. I always heard from my brothers that her independence was very disagreeable to them. She persisted in training for a contrary to the wishes of our family, who do not appreciate this independence of a young woman who chooses to learn an honorable profession, as we do in this country. I suppose from my recollections of the pride of birth so strongly felt in Ireland, they considered she was following a menial service not suitable to the dignity of the family. Thank God I no such feelings of pride, and doubt if I ever had. I would have been only too glad to afford her all the assistance in my power if asked by her. She is now head nurse in Providence Hospital I believe in the City of Cork. She is an advanced Nationalist of the most extreme type, I learn. </p><p>This is why cousin Gaffney may have thought her the best of the name, as he was a most enthusiastic ultra Irishman himself.  In a recent letter to my daughter Clare from her cousin Ned Gaffney of Dublin, he described her as being "off" on most subjects and said the only sane thing about her was the fact of her being his Godmother. I believe she is so thoroughly Celtic in her ideas that she dresses in some queer style of the middle centuries of the Christian era. Maybe shell come round yet, as Longfellow says , which may be applicable to her case: "We must be patient and assuage the feeling we may not wholly stay; By silence sanctifying not concealing, etc." I mean to keep silence with her for some little time before I write her again.</p><p> And the last of the family was poor Frank.  The youngest and perhaps the perhaps the brightest. He was like our Richard Malcolm when I bid him goodbye for the last time on earth. A bright little fellow very much Richard in appearance, manner and disposition.  As the baby of the family he was naturally the pet, but was by no means a spoiled child. He showed great mechanical tastes for one so young, which afterward developed into genius, I learn. At the last breakfast I had at home I asked him if he would miss me.  With tears in eyes, but a broad smile on his lips he answered, "Yes, but you are going to leave me the key of your workshop. This was a precious charge I promised to place in his care. From my earliest years I had a taste for mechanics, and had accumulated a large number of tools and light machinery with which I fitted up a workshop in the ruins of the old castle of Port Royal at our home. This building was battered down by Cromwellians on account of its having sheltered King James who gave it the name of Port Royal. The original name in Irish being Partree or the "King's Portion" in English -- hence James' equivalent of the Celtic name. We were living in what was known as the "Dower House" which escaped destruction, being a few hundred yards away in the woods from the older castle. </p>
