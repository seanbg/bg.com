<h4> Preface</h4><p>I have often contemplated making a few memoranda of incidents in my life which may be of interest to my family in after years.  Inasmuch as I am not a native American, and that they may know something of their trans-atlantic relatives if ever they may be able to visit Europe and Ireland, the land of my birth especially.  There are no very strange or unusual incidents to relate, but the ordinary chronicle of a simple life, calm and uneventful, but exceptionally happy on the whole. Fortunately, my memory holds most strongly to the pleasantest recollections from earliest years to the present time - "I note not the hours unless they be bright" has been a favorite quotation occurring to my mind since I read that it was engraved on a sundial in some old Florentine monastery. I love to remember only the bright side of life and bury in oblivion disagreeable things.</p><p>Since circumstances have so changed my manner of living within the past few months, and I am so far removed from home and its attractions, compelled to travel from place to place by the requirements of my engineering work, forced to live in hotels and boarding houses as best I may; - after the days work is done I am necessarily much alone in my room in the evenings, where I read or write letters to offset a sense of utter loneliness. Then having so much time to write, without any domestic attractions to interfere I feel I cannot do better than essay a little autobiography as it were, and a biography of my parents, brothers and sisters and maybe touching on my uncles and aunts and cousins incidentally they are so numerous I may not do justice to them all, not forgetting my many nieces and nephews - that my children may know something of their kindred if their paths in life should cross each other ever.</p><p>Naturally I commence at my birth as being the most important event in my life.. though actively present I cannot claim any vivid recollections of this event, and must rely upon hearsay. I was born on the 11th of March, St. Patrick's Day, in 1850, and am now in my fifty-seventh year. My birth place was a little cottage called "Doogarry" in the County Mayo, Ireland. The church in which I was baptize has now become so well known as the "Chapel of Knock", since it was believed, some few years ago in the surrounding neighborhood, that the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared as a vision against the gable end of this church. For a little while it seemed to rival the celebrated Grotto of Lourdes, but the reported miracles occurring at Knock were not sanctioned by ecclesiastical authority, and the Plaster of Knock" taken from the gable of the church, is now seldom heard of as being held in special veneration as a relic. "Doogary was not our regular home residence. My father and mother had gone down there on a mission of charity to look after the poor peasant farmers art1ers of the place who had suffered so grievously in the famines of previous years, and I was born there under these circumstances, which may have unconsciously influenced my whole life, by an inherited love for the poor and suffering, from my dear mothers breast. As the sun sinks in the Atlantic Ocean on the west of the island it casts the shadow of "Croagh Patrick" the "Hill of St. Patrick" on the place of my birth, and I have reason to be proud of my birthplace and of the feast of the great patron saint of Ireland. </p><p>My father, Edward, was the second son of Thomas Gaffney, of near Grannard in the county of Longford, Ireland. He had one brother and four sisters, of whom more anon. My father received a very fine classical education, and studied engineering under the greatest engineer of his day, William Lovell Edgeworth, uncle to Maria Edgeworth, the Authoress, and Godmother of my eldest brother Tom. But I am anticipating events. Father travelled extensively in his early years with Mr. Edgeworth in the course of his professional work. On one occasion when in London with his chief, the latter suggested to my father that he would go down to near Birkenhead, where the first steam railroad in the world was being built, and see the "newfangled toy" as he called the locomotive, which was claimed to go at twenty miles per hour. Father did go, saw and was completely conquered by the possibilities of the "newfangled toy", and returned fully impressed that it was to be the future means of travel. His chief felt grieved that his young assistant could be lead so far astray, as he expected so much from him. Father subsequently became the pioneer of railway building in Ireland.</p>
