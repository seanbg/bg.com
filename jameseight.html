<h4> Chapter 8 </h4><p>"But you've been over thirty years in this country!" I said, "And she is only twenty, you must be surely mistaken."  He was very positive he was right however.  I wrote this incident to Tom, and soon after Jennie wrote to say that it was true about Jerry's story, except that it was her eldest sister Mary who used to do the riding on Jerry's poor back. Jennie was the youngest of twelve children., Jennie being one of twelve and Tom of fourteen -- no wonder they did so well for the their country and the credit of both families!</p><p>Next in order comes my second eldest brother John. He, too, was a very bright student, and always kept up in his studies with Tom without any of the hard study that Tom made. The latter was slow but sure, the other quick to learn when he applied himself earnestly. He was more fond of music and dancing than Tom was, and had a very fine voice.  He was an accomplished musician on several instruments. From their earliest youth my elder brothers had tutors to teach them and prepare for college, so that when they entered they were so far advanced in knowledge they graduated at a very early age, both at the same time. We younger boys also had the advantages of these same tutors, Mr. Gray and Mr. Mooney, but we did not follow so brilliantly our brothers' example.</p><p>John studied in Dublin and in Edinburgh for the medical profession with honors.  He then entered the Army and his regiment, the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry, was soon sent to India.  Here his talents were early recognized and he received rapid promotion.  Earl Dufferin, who was then Viceroy of India, attached him to his staff, and before retirement appointed him Commissioner of the Upper District -- one of the healthy parts of India. Here he remained until he retired from the Service with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He holds two commissions from Victoria -- his first from her as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and the other as Empress of India, when he became her representative as Commissioner, which is an office similar to that of Governor of a territory of the U.S. Before he went to India, however, he became engaged to Miss Jessie Sinclair, an Englishwoman of means, a convert to Catholicism. They were not married for several years afterwards, until he returned on his first vacation. They were a most devoted couple, but unfortunately have had no family. John always devoted to children, and no younger brothers and sisters ever a kinder or more lovable elder brother than he. We always had more of respect for Tom, but we could play any tricks on John who seemed enjoy our childish pranks. </p><p>He was a great lover of pets of every kind -- animals, birds and even fishes, he seemed to have some instinctive manner of training. A Jackdaw he taught to speak like a parrot and sent his lady love Jessie in England once played an embarrassing trick on him. When he visited her soon after Jessie wanted a good servant to look after her ponies -- John sent one of our retainers, Michael, to her, entrusted him with the Jackdaw. On brother's next visit to her, in London, he asked after the Jackdaw, and. Jessie immediately had it brought in. The bird seemed much pleased to see its old friend and master, and strutted about the table for some time;  being urged to speak by my brother last cocking his head to one side he said: "Ha Ha, I saw John kiss Jessie." Imagine the astonishment of John and the horror of Jessie, as there were other guests present. It appears Michael had taught him to say that, as well as many other things he ought not to say. </p><p>I have had many most interesting letters from John written from India and elsewhere on his travels. His descriptions of the "Durbars" annual receptions he held in District, when the native princes and people came to pay their respects him as representative of the Empress of India -- they read like tales from the "Arabian Nights".  He sent us some beautiful specimens of Indian silver filigree work soon after our marriage, and later a bamboo coin which 1imself cut in the jungles and had mounted with a silver head. Previous to his being appointed Commissioner he had been sent to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands were inhabited by fierce tribes of cannibals, who used to kill and eat any shipwrecked sailors reaching their shores. He made a report on these islands and established a military station there for protection of such as were driven there by shipwreck. He brought off two of the wild natives of boyhood age and endeavored to civilize them. They were the only animals he ever failed in training. They both escaped and were lost in the jungles, presumably themselves being eaten by tigers.</p>
