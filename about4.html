<p>Frank enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy when he finished
  Grade 11 in 1943, and trained as a signalman in St. Hyacinth, Quebec.
  Before being sent overseas in September, he was given a brief leave during
  which he visited Mary in Montreal where she was taking her Grade 12 studies
  at the Convent of the Sacred Heart<em> Sault-au-Recollet.</em>  He remembered
  he was allowed to take her for dinner to Murray's Restaurant after which
  they roamed St. Catherine St., talking about their dreams.</p>
<p>He joined the British Navy in the North Atlantic,  first
  on the British ship HMS Nigeria in Greenoch, Scotland, and later HMS Jamaica.
  He was able to visit Uncle Jack and had a memorable evening as his guest
  at the Officers Mess at the Royal Irish Regiment headquarters in England,
  to the dismay of a British officer at the presence of a humble seaman,
  and a colonist at that. </p>
<p>In  1944, he was transferred to the newly commissioned HMCS
  Uganda in Charleston, N.C., and proceeded to the Pacific, South Pacific
  and Mediterranean . After the war, he marvelled that he always seemed
  to be just over the horizon from desperate battles  but never in harm's
  way.  After demobilization, he was a member of the local Naval Reserve,
  Ret., the Naval Officers Association, Ret., and the Royal Canadian Legion
  No. 102. His name is inscribed on the Honor List at the Naval Museum of
  Manitoba.</p>
<p>In September Frank, demobilized from the navy, returned home
  and to St. Paul's to complete his matriculation, in the course of which
  he met Lois Helen Kane of Calgary.  Early in 1948 he worked in a lumber
  camp in western Ontario and in September, taking advantage of his veteran's
  credits, enrolled at St. Michael's College, Toronto, in the two-year Arts
  program.  He met Lois again in Toronto during Calgary's 1949 Grey Cup
  invasion and victory.  (John remembers being in the Winnipeg train station,
  recording the Calgary team's return, finding Lois so hoarse from cheering
  she had lost her voice.)  In 1951, Frank moved to Calgary to pursue a
  career as landman in the oil industry – and, without doubt, Lois Kane.
  His early work, traveling in a battered Volkswagen ahead of a proposed
  oil pipeline to secure leases and rights, convinced him of his choice
  of career but also of the need to improve his skills:  he took up a two-year
  course in engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton.  He and
  Lois were married at Sacred Heart Church, Calgary, June 14, 1952</p>
<p>Frank became an active member of Sacred Heart Parish, of
  the Canadian Association of Landmen, and of the community.  Over the years
  he was elected a trustee for the Calgary Roman Catholic School District
  No. 1, he became president of Alberta Catholic School Trustees Association,
  president of Calgary Centre Liberal Association, and a tireless volunteer
  for the Salvation Army, the Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian
  Cancer Society and the Stephen Avenue Mall Authority.  Frank later formed
  his own consulting agency 'Finjay' –  a play on his initials.</p>
<p>Their children followed: Sean Joseph (1953), Kevin Francis
  (1958), twins Noel Lawrence and Brian Joseph (1960), and Mary Elizabeth (1961).  Later,
  Lois took up the politics of the Catholic School Board, successfully ran
  for office and was elected a trustee, a <a href="/trusteelois/">position she holds to this day</a>.  She went on to chair the Board
  and to represent it in the Senate of the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Frank died peacefully at the Rockyview General Hospital on
  October 15, 1997, of pancreatic cancer, diagnosed a year earlier. Frank's
  immediate family and hundreds of friends attended his funeral October
  20 at Sacred Heart Church, Calgary. Besides his loving wife, Francis is
  survived by his daughter Elizabeth, his four sons Sean, Kevin, Brian and Noel,
  two daughters-in-law, Cynthia and Cheri and eight grandchildren.</p>
