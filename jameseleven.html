<!-- <h4> Chapter 11</h4>-->
<p>Josephine, as she was then and always will be to my fondest recollections, and I were the guests of the nuns the day we had the happiness to receive our Holy Communions. They dressed her in the garb of a little nun for that event, which may have inspired her young mind to adopt the habit later in life. I can still remember the trouble the sisters were put to in keeping me out of mischief that blessed day and how happy they felt when our Mother called for us in the evening.  In the afternoon we were brought into the mortuary chapel to pray for the souls of the deceased sisters whose coffins were cemented into receptacles in the surrounding walls. In an inquiring frame of mind I lifted a little lid on the altar and discovered the altar stone which I was examining with interest when discovered by the sisters to their horror. I was brought immediately before the chaplain who must have let me off with a very light sentence, as I cannot now remember his reproof for my curiosity.  For the remainder of the day I was put in guard of two sisters to keep me out of mischief. Within the past month my sister Columba has been made Rev. Mother of a new convent opened at Head fort, about ten miles from Tuam where she has been over thirty years. I have not heard from her in her new home. </p><p>Next to Josephine was poor Walter who died at a very early age, about 18 years. He gave promise of being the handsomest of the boys singularly graceful and attractive, of most refined mind and manners. I was sincerely attached to him and felt very proud of him whenever he accompanied me at any public gathering. He commenced early to study medicine and had passed his first year in hospital work when stricken typhoid fever attending an old nurse who was in hospital with this disease. His early death affected me extremely, and he died in my arms. I was the one of the family permitted to be near him during his illness, as on the night he first showed symptoms of the disease he had awakened as if disturbed by a nightmare, and came into my bed where I calmed him to sleep. Next morning the doctor declared it was typhoid or more probably typhus fever, and we were quarantined from the rest of the household. He is buried in the cemetery of Boyle, les Rossevinmore, Ireland. </p><p>Marguerite was next to Walter. I am now approaching the younger members of the family who have grown up since I left home. She gave promise of being a very fine woman. She was unusually grave and dignified for her years as she was not yet even sweet sixteen when I last saw her; she was even then as tall as any of her sisters, and did not show any of the peculiar Burke characteristics.  I have heard my aunts Margaret and Anne say she bore a most striking resemblance to Father's first wife, Mary 0'Brian. This may have been only imaginary, but she certainly resembled more the Gaffney side of the family than any of the girls.  Brother Tom, who is of an artistic nature, writing me a few years after I left home, said in a recent visit he had paid there that he thought she was the loveliest and most graceful girl he had seen as she glided down to the gate to greet him, she was dressed all in white. All I know about her now is that she is a governess in some family in France. I do not even know her address.  I must have grown out of the recollections of the younger brothers and sisters, and perhaps seem to them as a myth of a brother, as one dead and partly forgotten. Perhaps if we were to meet again the long forgotten associations of early youth might be formed into a warmer friendship if not love.  I cannot picture them in my mind's eye other than the little loved ones left behind. I was then as fond of children as I have been in later years, and I know they were dearly attached to me, as I was more at home than any of my brothers;  I was looked upon and called "The Young Master" by the kindly peasantry of the neighborhood, my brothers being considered visitors only on their annual vacations.  I was called "Sir Galahad" by my sisters on account of my devotion to them, and hence I feel these younger ones loved me as I loved them. </p>
