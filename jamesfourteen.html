<h4> Chapter 14</h4><p>Well, to return to Frank.  I was not home during his schooldays, but I believe he was mostly instructed by my father who had then retired from public service, and had plenty of leisure to devote to Frank's education.  And right well must he have done it, as Frank's success in the engineering profession was phenomenal in so young a man. He was first engaged in Government work in Ireland. Then he was sent to Egypt in connection with drainage and water-works in that vast country, afterwards he was sent to Singapore. Here he rose rapidly until he became head of all government works in the British possessions there. He returned to Ireland on vacation in 1899 or 1900 and married Gertrude Haggerty of County Cork, a very rich and beautiful young lady. I may remark here that it is a singular coincidence that both my brothers, Tom and Frank, wrote me on announcing their approaching marriages that they were first attracted to their future brides by their fancied resemblance to photographs of my wife Agnes which I had sent them previously. I was married four or five years previously to Tom and many more years before Frank. I have since heard from visitors to Ireland that Jennie, Tom's wife, did bear a striking resemblance to Agnes. I have not yet me anyone who has seen Agnes and Gertrude, so I do not know if they are so much alike. As I set the pace it surely shows I had good taste in choosing a wife. </p><p>Poor Frank did not live long to enjoy his happy wedded life:  he died on the 6th of September, 1904, at a summer resort north of Singapore, of an abscess on the liver -- a disease incident to that tropical climate, leaving a dear little boy, Edward, called after his grandfather.  Frank was Commandant of the Royal Engineers, Member of the Council of Colonial Governments, and many other offices which entitled him to the preface of "Honorable".  Gertrude seemed inconsolable for some years since his death. She has written me the saddest letters I ever read, and I have always tried to impress her that such grief was immoderate. She is young however, and time will naturally heal the deepest wounds of the heart, if born with Christian resignation.  Although her address is always "Fort William" Cork, Ireland, she has been traveling around England, Ireland, and France for the past two years, since her return from the far East.</p><p> This then closes the chapter of my brothers' and sisters' biographies.</p>
<h4>Appendix</h4>
<p>James' nephew Lt. Col. Jack Burke-Gaffney, completed his own record of the Gaffneys in 1956.  The following extract from that story gives a brief description of Jamestown life.</p><p>"In April 1871 James followed his brother Edward to the United States. . . James (took) up employment with the Victoria Railway, Lindsay, Ontario, Canada, where he remained for some years before returning to the States.  In 1878 he became resident engineer to the George Creek and Cumberland Railroad, and went to Cumberland, Maryland, to live. Two years later he married Agnes Coulehan, a daughter of Judge Coulehan, and thereafter made his home in Cumberland, where he reared his family.  Of the eleven children born to them they had the misfortune to lose six before they reached maturity, only one of the five boys and four of six girls reaching adult age.</p><p>In 1906, after nearly thirty years, James gave up his appointment with the George Creek and Cumberland Railroad, and accepted appointment as resident engineer with another railroad company, the Norfolk and Southern Railroad.  This proved to be a most unfortunate change, for the following year a financial panic swept over the United States and many companies went to the wall. The Norfolk and Southern failed to weather the storm, and in 1908 it went bankrupt.  James returned to Cumberland and set up in private practice as a consulting engineer.</p>

<p>It was a difficult time of life for this misfortune to have overtaken James.  He was sixty-two years old.  He had six surviving children, none of whom was yet in a position to add to the family revenue, and most of whom were of school age or under.  These were, Clare, who had recently taken up the study of professional nursing, and was with the Sisters of Charity, Baltimore;  Josephine, Gerald, Monica and Richard, all still at school;  and finally Kathleen, as yet not of school age.  With such responsibilities, it would have unnerved many a strong man to have to face the problem of having to set up on his own.  But James, a deeply religious man, never failed in his faith that God would provide.  He had the great advantage of being well known and respected in Cumberland, and so in due course began slowly to build up a private practice.  It was a hard struggle, and so it came as a great relief when in 1912 he was appointed City Engineer to the city of Cumberland.</p><p>Although now back on a salaried job all was not yet well with James.  For although his professional qualifications were unimpeachable, he was the possessor of one characteristic which, in view of some of the city fathers of those days, was not only an unnecessary, but even an undesirable characteristic.  This was the characteristic of integrity.  Shortly before he had been appointed, the City Council had voted a half a million bond issue for the construction of a new water supply for the city.  They had employed an 'eminent' New York engineer to have entire charge of the engineering and construction work.  This eminent man employed inexperienced men on the job, and failed to supervise the work as he should have done.  When James inspected progress on the work and afterwards reported his dissatisfaction with it to the City Council, he was told that it was none of his business.</p><p>But his charter as City Engineer made him responsible for approving the monthly estimates before payment.  James had the last say and would not pass them until he was satisfied.  The discovery of an error of five thousand dollars, previously passed as correct by a predecessor, which James insisted on having deducted from the next estimate, opened the eyes of the Council, so that James' exposure of graft and the stand he had made was made an issue at the next election for City Commissioners.  Fortunately James' friends were returned to office and he was re-elected city engineer for another two years.  He left the employment of the City in 1916.  James died in Cumberland in 1917.  Only five of his children survived him to comfort his wife Agnes in her loss, for to the great grief of those devoted parents, their son Gerald had died in 1910, in his sixteenth year.  Agnes survived her husband for another sixteen years and died in 1933.</p>
<p class="inset">As an added postscript: On the date I close this revival of James' biographies, his youngest daughter, Kathleen Louise (Sister Monica Clare, CSC) is approaching her 99<sup>th</sup> birthday in the Holy Cross Convent, Notre Dame, Indiana. We have recently corresponded.</p><h5> John Burke-Gaffney (1921)<br /> Nanaimo,B.C.<br /> October 14, 2001</h5>
