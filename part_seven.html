<h4>school days</h4>
      <p>In 1928, Patrick bought 779 Jessie, across the street, where
        the family spent the rest of its Winnipeg years -- his first grandson
        Pat kept the place alive and raised his children there as well.  St. Ignatius
        school, three blocks away, became an annex to 779.  As well as scholarship
        itself, it provided an opportunity to sing in the children's choir, a
        lighted skating rink in winter, tennis courts and sports in summer, and,
        at least for the four boys, service as altar boys that made them feel
        privileged and enriched. </p>
      <p>As each child advanced through the grades, his unhappy successor
        heard the same nuns compare them to the paragon gone before.  The Sisters
        of the Holy Names tended to be tough-minded farm girls who kept effortless
        discipline with abiding warmth.  All of us counted them among our friends
        as we became adults.</p>
      <p>The huge church basement bustled with activity during the
        season with Cubs and Boy Scouts, bazaars when we were given a small coin
        and allowed to stay 'late' to watch the games of chance and to sample
        some delight or another, plays and presentations. Mother and Dad always
        attended those school functions, sports and plays that featured their
        children.</p>
      <p>Mother was always at home; she had endless washing, starching
        of shirt collars and ironing. Like Dad, we all came home for lunch --
        to stay at school for lunch was the rarest of treats, usually in connection
        with some project or cause.  Mother did not bake bread or spend time pickling
        and canning but she made great cakes with boiled icing, unbeatable shortbread
        fingers, and her specialty, delicious Irish soda bread.  </p>      <p>In those days, Mother bought much of the family's supplies
        from vendors with their horse-drawn wagons.  Every service seemed local:
        our bread and cakes were made in the Bryce Bakery factory down the street
        and delivered by van, and the Bryce family lived down the street; we went
        to the funeral of Tony Delapanto, the Italian 'vegetable man' whose horse
        we fed and knew by name; the Arctic Ice delivery man went to St. Ignatius
        Church.  The children of Mr. Ringer, the druggist, went to school with
        us;  Mr. Locke, the butcher, and Wilf Bease, the grocer, kept accounts
        which Mother paid periodically, and we picked up the orders.  All of them
        knew us by name and reputation.  </p>
      <p>Mary recalls,&quot;I don't remember Mother accompanying Dad
        for social affairs connected with his business; she was shy about this
        or not interested in a certain social class. She was always ready for
        a good chat with neighbours and went to bridge parties and church teas. 
        Although there was an atmosphere creating a sense of God's immediate presence,
        holy pictures and frequent references to doing the Holy Will of God, there
        were few overt manifestations like saying the Rosary together in the home. 
        Apart from obligatory Sunday Mass, there was Sunday Benediction and the
        Rosary at church during October and May, as well as special novenas and
        often daily Mass especially during Lent. All of us were encouraged to
        go to confession frequently. "</p>
      <p>That the children all attended Catholic schools tells of
        the importance to the parents of education in the faith.  The financial
        sacrifice must have been great; there was a time when the burden was threefold:
        provincial taxes which went only to public schools, fees at the private
        schools, and the contributions to the semi-monthly collection at church
        supporting St. Ignatius Parochial School.  As well, private-school students
        had to provide their own text books, although in time the family accumulated
        enough books to operate its own respectable reference library.  Reading
        had high priority.</p>
      <p>Another memory:  we entertained each other in a variety of
        ways.  We ate together at every meal;  being together for dinner was important,
        especially on Sunday, and we traded stories about our individual exploits
        and chatted about shared interests.  Homework had to be finished before
        sitting down to dinner, so the evening could be spent together.  There
        were always good plays or music on the radio or the phonograph.  On occasion,
        Dad would show a film projected on a white sheet hanging from the arch
        between living and dining rooms (we got special delight from films run
        backwards!);  after a film, Dad would rig a plank from the dining table
        as a narrow stage so we could take turns alone or in pairs in the glare
        of the projector, having our silhouettes cast on the sheet, inventing
        plays or making strange creatures of our shadows.</p>
      <p>Perhaps these improvisations led us into public performances
        of one kind and another;  we all took part in school plays and debates. 
        About 1930, Ted and Des had roles in a Catholic play, based on the Acts
        of the Apostles, presented first on the St. Ignatius stage and then at
        a larger theatre downtown:  Des was cured by Peter at the Gate Beautiful,
        Ted was a Greek selling idols of Diana.  At St. Paul's high school, Des
        acted in &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; and &quot;Grotesque in November&quot;
        and in a funny review in which he and Paul Allen, as a girl on a swing,
        sang &quot;If you were the only girl in the world...&quot;  A crowd pleaser. 
        Mother became expert at sewing costumes, and accompanied us to Malabar's,
        the theatre store, to choose wigs and face-paint.  Mary had opportunities
        to act in high school, as Creon in &quot;Antigone&quot; and Mrs. Malaprop
        in &quot;School for Scandal.&quot;  John and Frank joined their talents
        in 1946 in a major presentation at the Walker Theatre of &quot;The Song
        of Bernadette&quot; sponsored by the Catholic Youth Organization.  John
        began writing radio plays in high school instead of studying.  In all
        this, the school and church gave us a wide circle of friends with much
        in common, friendships that lasted beyond our schooldays.  And Dad and
        Mother were always in the front row, applauding.  Dad would frequently
        leave congratulatory notes on the newel post for latecomers.</p>
      <p>Both Dad and Mother were active at St. Ignatius Church and
        St. Paul's High School and St. Agnes Priory (Good Shepherd Home) during
        the Thirties.  Mother served on the Board of St. Paul's Women's Guild. 
        Dad wasn't a joiner although he had an arm's length connection with the
        Knights of Columbus, mainly, one suspects, for the insurance package that
        went with membership;  outside of family, church, school and university
        bonds he devoted himself to the engineering profession.</p>      <p>As an aside, all the boys served Mass at the church and at
        St. Mary's Academy at early hours (with breakfast of steak and eggs with
        the caretakers.  Each Friday morning a nun would count out three 25-cent
        coins for our services), and all the children sang in school choirs through
        the years.  Dad, in particular, had a great fondness for classical music
        and the house frequently rang with recordings of some kind of music. 
        Despite lessons, only Mary showed her mother's talent for piano;  none
        of the others mastered an instrument, other than Ted's ukulele.</p>
      <p>All the children took active parts in the Boy Scout/Girl
        Guide movement.  We have a photograph of Ted in the regalia of an Eagle
        Scout, covered with merit badges.  Through the Scouts in those days, John
        participated in YMCA activities and developed his interest in photography. 
        And the boys went camping in trips organized through school and Scouts,
        often borrowing tents and equipment from Scout headquarters to camp on
        the Seine River at St. Norbert on the monastery grounds.</p>
