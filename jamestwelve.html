<h4> Chapter 12</h4><p>Next came Anastasia as she was baptised, I believe, but her name was intended to be Austice after her aunt, but I believe there is no Latin equivalent for this -- hence "Anastasia".  She was peculiarly dear to me, I remember, such another little fairy as Monica is now when I left home.  She went out to India to visit John and Jessie, and there met married a young English officer of a regiment stationed there named Alfred Bulkley of a fine old family of wealth of Leicestershire, I believe. They have a large family, I understand. Their eldest son is now in the Indian Army.  Captain Bulkley has retired from the Service, having been wounded in East Africa during the Boer War. They are now temporarily residing in Dublin, where Annie, as we always called her, is having. her children educated, notwithstanding her acquired prejudice against the Irish.  Her faith it seems is still greater than this supposed prejudice as she wishes her children to be educated in a more Catholic atmosphere than in the surroundings of their non-Catholic relatives in England, Bulkley being a Protestant but faithfully having the children brought Catholics. They are a lovely family I learn from the correspondence with my other brothers and sisters who know them. Annie is another of them who never writes to me. </p><p>Charles comes next to Annie. He is another physician. Four brothers have studied medicine. There were many doctors on Mothers side. She had an uncle, a brother, nephew  and cousins, all doctors of medicine. Charles of course was also very young when I left home. He was in his second year at St. Jarloth's college in Tuam, Co. Galway when he came to America. He was rather undersized for his age as I remember him and was about the smallest boy then at his college. The great McHale, Archbishop of Tuam, who was a life-long friend of my Father's house, took a great interest in Charles and had him serve his mass every day. His Grace hoped I believe that he might develop a vocation for the priesthood, but Charles preferred to study surgery and entered the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin at an unusually early age. He took a brilliant course and carried off every honor of his classes. So much had he advanced, he was encouraged to enter for his examination a year ahead of his time by his professors. He passed with such success that he not only carried off the highest honors attainable in the famous college, but he was voted a considerable library of his professional books by the faculty, and was immediately appointed junior demonstrator in Anatomy in his Alma Mater. This was considered unprecedented in the history of the college, which is considered the highest college of surgeons in the British Isles. Students who fail in passing examinations, in this college often go to Edinburgh College pull through there. Hence to be able to attach R.C.S.D. to one's name was considered very honorable. </p><p>He sprung into very high reputation soon and his practice became very large, and in addition to his surgery he became very successful as a "coacher" for young men preparing them for examinations. He worked too hard and his health broke down, and was advised to take a complete rest for some months. In the meantime he had married a distant relative of ours, Mary Griffin, and had three or four children born to their union. One of these died and is buried in the family lot at Glasnevin near Dublin where Father and Mother are buried.  To attain this complete rest, he took a voyage in a sailing vessel to Australia. His fame had reached there ahead of him, and on arrival there he was offered and accepted the professorship of surgery in the medical college of Melbourne. The climate agreeing with him and liking the country, he sent for his family, and they have resided there since.</p><p> I have not heard of him for many years. The last letter I had from him was an application for some money he said he needed to help him with his college course.  I sent him a hundred and fifty dollars to him through his brother Tom, thinking it might be more profitably spent for his benefit by Tom, who already had borne the principle expenses of his college course. Tom applied this money to the necessary expenses of his graduation. Charles was so offended that I did not send it direct to him, considering I some doubt of his using it properly -- although being the beneficiary this gift he never wrote to thank me, and this created a breach which has not since been bridged, although I have written him a few letters which he never acknowledged. It is strange that a generous impulse on my part was so little appreciated by him. He, though, was too young when I left home for him to remember me with other than the most abstract feelings of affection. </p>
