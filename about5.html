      <h4>About Mary</h4>
      <p>One of our family stories tells of Mary, exasperated, saying
        to Mother, "You and your precious sons!"  Mary suffered all the disadvantages
        of being the youngest child in a male-oriented household but she took
        a special place in her father's heart because she shared many of his interests,
        which he nourished as she grew up.  </p>
      <p>Sometime after the Religious of the Sacred Heart came to
        Winnipeg (1935) she had been taken to visit them and was charmed with
        the house and by the nuns.  Dad's sister, Nellie, was an RSCJ who died
        in Roscrea, Ireland in 1923.  Mary was told that it was a good thing there
        were no Loretto sisters in the area or there would have been a difficulty
        about where she would go to school since these were &quot;Mother's nuns.&quot; 
        Mary enrolled in the Sacred Heart school on Westgate Road for her Grade
        9 in 1940 and loved it:  in addition to the standard Manitoba curriculum,
        she was introduced to mythology, logic and psychology.  Gweneth Lloyd
        and Betty Hay who founded the Royal Winnipeg Ballet Company taught dancing
        at the school.  </p>
      <p>After graduating from Grade 11, which gave entrance to University,
        Mary chose to take Grade 12 but  not at the girls' college in Winnipeg
        -- Dad was not happy about her going out to the university campus -- but
        went to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (<em>Sault-au-Recollet</em>) in
        Montreal. She recalls, "My  ideas about boarding-school fun soon vanished."  
        Her unhappiness as a boarder must have concentrated her mind because she
        won a scholarship offered that year for the first time to a Canadian &quot;Sacred
        Heart girl&quot; for Maryville College, St. Louis, Miss..  (Coincidentally,
        the prize was in honour of Mary T. O'Loane, a Canadian nun who had taught
        at Maryville, a sister of the Denison family of Winnipeg whose son was
        a friend of Des.) </p>
      <p>She graduated from Maryville, May 1948.  Mother and Dad travelled
        to St. Louis for the ceremony, then the three took the train across to
        Washington, D.C. to visit the James Gaffney family there (Patrick's uncle),
        then up to Montreal to see the Glenny family and to take the long train-trip
        home.</p>
      <p>Mary worked for a year at the University of Manitoba Science
        Library, and at Great West Life Insurance who offered her the prospect
        of becoming an actuary – a considerable compliment, we all thought.  Instead,
        September 1949, she entered the novitiate of the Sacred Heart, Albany,
        New York, where, in 1952, she made her first vows in the Society, once
        again with her parents in attendance as well as her priest-brother Des,
        who had been ordained the year before, and her uncle Walter, S.J. Soon
        after, Mary returned to Canada briefly to teach at <em>Sault-au-Recollet</em>
        in Montreal.  She returned in 1956 to being a student at Manhattanville
        College, Graduate Division, Albany, N.Y.  In September 1957 she was awarded
        her M.Ed., then went on to Rome to prepare for her final vows which she
        made February 10, 1958, at the Society of the Sacred Heart 'Mother House'
        on <em>Via Nomentana</em> in Rome. </p>
      <p>In March she returned to Winnipeg, to her parents' delight,
        to teach maths, physics, English, history and Latin at the Westgate convent
        where she remained for nine years – during which the Vatican Council introduced
        a whirlwind of changes that directly affected Mary, her institutions and
        lifestyle.  In 1969, she moved to Vancouver to UBC for studies leading
        to a Library Sciences degree. </p>
        <p>That done, she was appointed in 1970 to the position of librarian
        at Sturgeon Creek Regional Secondary School, Winnipeg, where she spent
        four years, followed by four years at the Convent of the Sacred Heart,
        Vancouver, as librarian and maths teacher.</p>
      <p>Mary then spent 1977 to 1982 in Montreal in administration,
        Society of the Sacred Heart during which time she attended Dalhousie Library
        School, Halifax.  Through 1983-1997 she worked  in Winnipeg and Toronto
        as the librarian and secretary to the Canadian Religious Conference West,
        and in Montreal as librarian at the Canadian Centre of Ecumenism, also
        researching history of the Society of the Sacred Heart, Canada.  In 1998
        she was placed in charge of the aging French-speaking community on rue
        Wilfrid-st-louis, Montreal, and returned to the Sherbrooke Street convent
        in September, 2001.</p>
