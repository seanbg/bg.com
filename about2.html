      <h4>About Des</h4>
      <p>Des followed Ted through St. Ignatius School, making his
        mark in his sheer delight in everything around him: studies, sports and
        play.  The Dictionary of Jesuit Biography, 1991, says in the article on
        Uncle Walter, &quot;He mastered the art of conversation, and Jesuit community
        life was significantly enlivened by it, particularly when a Burke-Gaffney
        family trait revealed itself by an explosive outburst of temper.&quot; 
        If it really was a family trait, Des inherited not bad temper but outrage
        at unfairness and huge enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>John has a vivid recollection of the summer day in 1930 when
        Des, teased by a McPhee boy, chased him up the steps of his home with
        his fist cocked.  As he unleashed his left-handed blow, McPhee slammed
        shut the porch door which had small glass windows:  Des put his fist through
        the glass almost to his elbow.  John can still see Des, ignoring his torn
        arm spurting blood, calling McPhee to come outside to settle accounts. 
        Des had a vivid scar across the ball of his left thumb and up his forearm
        for the rest of his life.  (About 20 years later Des was writing an exam
        at the novitiate in Guelph when he felt a scratching on the paper from
        something protruding from the heel of his <em>right</em> hand:  he extracted
        a splinter of window glass.  It had traveled his entire system.)</p>
      <p>On another occasion, during a game, he broke his collarbone
        and had to wear a massive brace on his back for months while it healed. 
        Another trauma, not self-inflicted, caused him endless trouble when an
        infection in his left eye, probably acquired while swimming, eventually
        requiring removal of the duct. None of this slowed him down.</p>
      <p>By the time Des completed grade school in 1934, St. Paul's
        had a separate high school on the same downtown property as the college. 
        The two-storey new building, Paul Shea Hall, had been a gift of the Shea
        family, named after their son who died as a young man.  Jesuits filled
        most of the teaching posts, although they recruited some notable figures
        to direct the science department, for example, and the sports programs. 
        Des excelled in basketball, football and swimming.  At some point, Des
        -- perhaps Ted -- became involved with the Winnipeg Canoe Club, and for
        some years it became the summer hang-out, at least for the boys.  Mary
        remembers Dad driving Mother and herself to Selkirk to visit Des and friends
        stopping over on a canoe trip to Camp Morton.  The basswood canoe, with
        a distinctive black patch on its prow from an ancient collision, came
        into our possession somehow and was stored in the vast Club shed overlooking
        the Red River.  Several years later, John and his friend Brian Tobin made
        a similar trip but stopped at Selkirk.  Des took part in the frequent
        Club regattas and we can remember him paddling his heart out in a war-canoe
        race.</p>      <p>During his university years, Des was elected Senior Stick
        and was a very visible member of the student body in all its activities,
        especially in basketball, swimming and diving, and spent several summers
        as lifeguard at the swank Minaki Lodge in the Lake of the woods. He was
        very much at the centre of the social whirl so his decision in 1939 to
        enter the Society of Jesus after he graduated from U of M came as a surprise
        to some but not to his parents and faqmily.  He entered the Jesuit novitiate
        at Guelph, Ont., and in  1943 went to Loyola College, Montreal, for a
        one-year teaching stint.  In 1946, he moved to Regiopolis High School,
        Kingston, to teach as a scholastic, then, in 1948, to the Toronto seminary
        to study theology. </p>
      <p>Des was ordained June 25, 1951 at the Jesuit Seminary, Toronto; 
        Dad, Mother, Dot and Iris Glenny attended.  He said his first Solemn High
        Mass at St. Ignatius, Winnipeg, served by his brothers.  Shortly after,
        he returned to Toronto for his 4th year of theology.  In 1952, Des spent
        a year of spiritual theology in Rathfarnham Castle, Dublin, where he was
        able to visit his 88-year-old grandmother in Dublin and Uncle Jack, then
        63.</p>
      <p>In 1953,  Des moved to Fordham University, New York, to complete
        his M.A.and to begin doctoral studies;  he obtained both his M.A. and
        a Ph.D., his thesis being an edition of "The Epistle of Comfort" written
        by the Elizabethan poet Saint Robert Southwell, S.J.  Stanzas of a hymn
        written by Southwell were read at both his and Ted's funerals.  In 1959,
        he returned to Guelph to teach Jesuit scholastics.  After the doctorate
        he spent one more year in England (1958-59) doing research at the British
        Museum before returning to Guelph, Ontario, to teach English literature
        to young Jesuits at Ignatius College</p>
      <p>His life took a major turn in 1962 when he was transferred
        to St. Paul's College, Winnipeg, as assistant professor of English – and,
        of course, gave joy to his parents who relished his anecdotes.  Two years
        later, Des was appointed Rector of St. Paul's which had been suffering
        disagreements among its faculty, made worse by a decision by the Provincial
        Government to end its traditional funding of federated colleges.  A book
        of "Memories and Histories" published in 1999 contained this remark: "In
        June 1964 (Fr. Hugh Kierans) was succeeded by the Rev. Desmond P. Burke-Gaffney,
        a Jesuit of the old school, urbane, percipient, and resolute, one who
        preferred his own counsel and was certainly not inclined to take guidance
        from his fellow Jesuits or, least of all, his lay colleagues."  The author
        goes on to say that Des resolved many of the differences troubling the
        staff who found themselves in agreement with his clear-headed approach. 
        (All this comes as no surprise to his family who had witnessed his skills
        as a conciliator.)  His nieces and nephews have great stories to tell
        about Des who officiated at many of their life events from baptisms to
        weddings.  They remember him as great story teller and entertainer.</p>
      <p>From Winnipeg, the Society transferred him to Campion College,
        Regina, as Dean in 1969 where he gained a host of new friends, but kept
        up a flow of letters to his mother which she cherished.  He actually had
        a student fan club at Campion that once serenaded him in his office with
        a violin solo, and whose choir rendered a touching short concert at his
        sickbed.  He was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in 1976.  His
        brothers and sister visited him at the hospital where he was perfectly
        lucid.  John and Mary witnessed a typical scene as a young couple, former
        students he had married with their infant he had baptized, couldn't contain
        their grief at his impending death and Des was consoling them, not they
        him. </p>
      <p>Des died December 4 in Pasqua Hospital, Regina, Sask., at
        the age of 59  His death was mourned at a crowded wake service December
        7, a Regina funeral December 8, and a solemn funeral at St. Ignatius Church
        in Winnipeg.  He is buried in the Jesuit plot of St. Mary's Cemetery in
        Winnipeg, not far from where his parents lie.</p>
