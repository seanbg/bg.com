<!-- <h4> Chapter 7 </h4> -->
<p>Like Curran's daughter after the death of Robert Emmett to whom she was engaged, who became an exile in her sorrow from the ballad "here her young hero sleeps" my sister Mary after the death of Father and Mother -- Father following Mother within a year -- in 1882 and 1883, exiled herself from her native land and travelled extensively after a visit to the Rothschilds in France -- finally dying away down in Lima, South America. I never knew the reason of her cutting herself away so completely from her family. She was one of my best and kindest correspondents up to the time of Mannion's death. After that I never heard from her again. I fear her mind must have been affected by sorrow, although I have never heard so from any member of my family. I always felt previously that I was very dear to her from my earliest boyhood days, I had received so many manifestations of her love, and I certainly had even more than a brotherly love for her, as it was united with a certain respect due to her being many years older than I. I think she used to pet me pretty much as Clare does Richard now, and Clare is very much like her Aunt Mary in many respects. </p><p>Tom was the eldest son of our family. He followed father's footsteps, literally, as he entered the Government Service soon after graduating with honors. Before entering the service, however, he studied for a while under Iugin the great architect, and cultivated a natural taste for drawing and painting. He was very clever at pen and ink sketches - and had he continued in this line might have become famous, perhaps. He also wrote for the college paper called the "Omnibus".  I can remember a few lines of one poem he wrote and sent the "Omnibus" home.  It was thus: "The ripening ear, 'til its time draws near, Fears not the scythe I wiss."</p><p>Sister Josephine, only a pert little thing then, writing to congratulate him on his success, expressed the wish that the next time he mounted his Pegasus, she hoped it would be harnessed to an "omnibus." Tom entered the office of the General Survey and Valuation of Ireland under Fathers administration and  rose step by step until he became Chief Valuer, when retired by limitation, being 65 years of age, and was decorated by King Edward Vll in the "Order of Civil Service" for distinguished service.  He was one of twelve Irishmen, only, who have been so honored. Tom also had taste for languages and acquired French, German, Italian and Spanish; it being his habit to travel every summer to the special country whose language he was studying. In this way he learned to speak fluently in these languages. As we younger members of our family grew older, we began to think he would remain an old bachelor. He remained single as long as Father and Mother lived, and was indeed the best and most devoted a son as any parent could desire. Mother's age at death I think was 66 and Father's 84. Tom married, however, when about 50 years of age a Miss Jennie 0'Donnell of the County Limerick, and I believe she was not more than 20. They have been blessed with eleven children, ten of whom are living; their names are Edward, Patrick, Nellie, John, Criss, Ita, James, Noel and Walter, but this only makes nine, probably the tenth is Harry. My brother Tom now lives at 66 Eccles St., Dublin, Ireland. As I never had the pleasure of meeting my sister-in-law, Jennie, I do not know much about her or her family. I have had one or two letters from her brother, Father O'Donnell, thanking me for some donations to his church fairs. </p><p>A peculiar incident occurs to me in connection with the announcement made me by Tom of his approaching marriage. After I had taken his letter from the post office box and was reading this surprising piece of news on my way to my office, I overtook an old Irish man named Jerry O'Brian, one of the local queer characters of Cumberland, and in familiar manner slapping him on the back I quoted: "Till one Mr. O' Brian from Clare, how square etc" when he replied, "Sure I'm not from the County Clare, but from the County Limerick - just across the border".  "Do you know the 0'Donnells of Adair?", I asked, reading from my brothers letter the name of his fiance's family.  "Sure wasn't I born in Adair and reared by the O'Donnells when I was a very small gossoon," said he.  "My brother is going to marry Miss Jennie O'Donnell." said I.  "0h, the Lord be praised," he said, "Often and often have I carried her on my back till I was ready to drop dead, when she insisted on riding me around the yard."</p>
