<!-- <h4> Chapter 5 </h4>-->
<p>Mothers sister, Aunt Helen, married her first cousin, Walter Burke, an uncle of Joe Burke of Alabama. They had four daughters, I believe.  I only slightly remember one of them, Mary, who visited us when I was a very small boy. We younger ones had an idea that brother Tom was very much in love with this cousin, but on account of the too-close kinship, her parents being first cousins, neither of the families would consent to any closer ties between them. Uncle Walter was in the British Navy and became paymaster-in-chief of the Navy and ranking senior Admiral before he died, at some years over ninety. He lived in Plymouth, England, the latter part of his life. Cousin Mary married an Englishman, an officer in the Army, I do not remember his name. He became Catholic before marriage on account of a most fortunate escape from death by a bullet striking a medal of the Immaculate Conception, which Mary had sewn inside the lining of his uniform coat, together with an Agnus Dei, before he left with his regiment for India. They were engaged to be married at the time. On his return the wedding took place. Brother Tom and sister Mary were best man and bridesmaid respectively. It was said after the reception was over and the happy pair were leaving on their bridal tour the Groom put his head out of the carriage and said to Tom: "Pray for me, dear fellow". Tom, probably not too happy on seeing his loved Cousin leaving, the bride of another said, "Oh, go to the "-------------". The groom was so shocked he pulled in his head too suddenly and banged it against the top of the carriage door.  </p><p>I have never learned of the fate of my other cousins of this family. Mother's other sister Maria married a Mr. McGowan, an assistant of Father's. They had but two children, John and Amelia, who were left: orphans early in life, and were reared in our family, but before my time. I cannot now recollect what became of them. I have an idea that John turned out a wild young man, and had to leave our home, fearing the bad example he might give my brothers. Mothers sister Louise married a Mr. Gavagan, another of Fathers assistants, and left an only child, a son. He too was left an orphan, entered the British Army in early life and rose to high rank for special bravery.  He was living when I last heard of him through his brother John. John did not seem to think much of him because he designated him a "cad" notwithstanding his distinction in Army rank.</p><p>Before leaving the members of Mother's family I must mention a characteristic of our Grandfather Burke who I am sure has brought untold blessing on his children and children's children, no doubt. If the sins of parent are visited on their children for generations, why should not their virtue be rewarded in kind?</p><p> John Burke of Bekan and his good wife were a very pious couple. Grandfather died early leaving six young children, Mother being the youngest and little more than a baby. Grandfather much desired that one of his sons, preferably Joseph, would enter holy orders.  Neither of the boys having any vocation for the priesthood, it struck him that a right young man, a son of one of his tenants, might make a good priest, as he had known him in his youth. He had him educated accordingly and had the happiness to see him ordained. This inspired him to educate others until he had several young men at College, sometimes two or three together, all sons of his tenantry, and he lived t.o a ripe old age. He always insisted that these young men should live as members of his fami1y during their vacation days while going through college. My Mother being the youngest of the family and the most cherished by her father, became the pet of these young students and ever after her dearest friends throughout life. Year after year they made pilgrimages, as it were, to our home and mother was a younger sister to them through life. </p><p>After I came to America I was introduced to an old priest, a Father 0'Toole, at a friend's house in Brooklyn, N.Y. After looking at me earnestly a few moments he said: "Gaffney -- Gaffney" as if recalling a forgotten name. He then said, "For Gods sake, young man, can you say you are the son of Bee Burke of Bekan, I know you are, for you are an ugly picture of her" and by that time he had me folded to his bosom, and actually cried as he told me he was one of the early beneficiaries of my grandfather's bounty and had spent several summers in his house while studying for the ministry. </p>
