<h4> Chapter 2</h4><p>But previous to this, however, while yet a very young man he was sent to develop the lead mines in Valentia, an island in the Atlantic a little off from Derrynane Abbey, the home of the great Daniel 0'Connell, the "Liberator", as he was called on account of his great fight for Catholic Emancipation in Ireland, took a great liking for my father and insisted on his spending his Sundays with him, that he might hear mass regularly, and sent his carriage to the wharf for him, going and coming. Forty years after this Father returned this compliment to his grandson and namesake, by having him spend his Sundays at our home, when Daniel O'Connell Jr., was a clerk in the National Bank of Ballinrobe. </p><p>I am again running ahead in the story of my Father's life, and will return to Valentia.  While here, 0'Connell used my father's talents in his efforts for Emancipation. He induced him to enter for a professorship in Trinity College, Dublin, knowing if he passed, of which he seemed to have little doubt, that he could not accept the test oath which would be tendered him on accepting office -  which implied he believed that the "Catholic religion was damnable and heretical". Of course father refused to a take such an oath - he could not be appointed and O'Connell fought the matter through the courts until finally the House of Lords declared such a test oath unconstitutional: thus my father was the humble means by which O'Connell opened the doors of old Trinity to all denominations.</p><p>I must now refer to the romantic incidents of Father's first marriage, for my mother was his second wife.  When about 21 years of age he fell in love with Mary O'Brian, the daughter of Captain O'Brian of the British Navy and niece of Lord Inshaguim.  She was only seventeen, had lost her mother, and was living with two maiden sisters of her father in the County Kerry, not far from B Valentia.  While paying secret attention to the niece, the younger of the aunts thought that she was his special attraction and became devoted to him, while several years his senior. After a while father was sent to the West of Ireland to build a great public highway being constructed by the Government along the West Coast. He and his fiancé promised to write each other as often as the then infrequent mails would permit. But to his great anxiety and pain of heart he did not receive a word or hint from her. Not being able to stand this anxiety longer he started back on horse-back and traveled thus two nights and a day continuously, only to find he had been a single day late. Mary had left the day before with her father to sail for Bermuda, her health failing and fears being entertained by her father that she was going into a decline. </p><p>Father met a warm reception from the aunts, the younger upbraiding him with his treachery  as she called it. She had intercepted his letters to Mary as they came, letting the poor girl think that he was a "false young knight who loved as he rode way". Father went down heart broken to the seashore to whisper his sighs, I presume, by the wireless telepathy of the time to his lost sweetheart. Fortunately an old sailor who had carried him across often from the island of Valentia to visit his ladylove met him arid learned the cause of his sorrow, he consoled him by saying he believed the vessel could not have put out to sea the, evening before, as a severe storm had been raging beyond the outer bar and offered to take him out in his skiff to intercept the vessel if she had set sail. They did intercept the boat, which father boarded explained all to the lady and her father, she decided to go back with her lover, and the bluff old captain blessed them heartily. They were married 1mediately, but had only one year's happiness together. She died in giving birth to a daughter, which lived only long enough to be christened Mary, after her mother. </p><p>Father remained a widower eighteen years until he met my mother, who was only 18 years of age when he married her, the sane age of his daughter if she had lived. Mother was Brigid Burke, youngest daughter of John Burke of Bekan in the County of Mayo. John Burke, my grandfather, was the last of his name who held the title of "Hereditary Grand Schenacle of Ireland". The office having been abolished by the Act of the Union - that infamous measure by which Ireland lost her own parliament, and was made a dependency of England merely - while the King still remains "King of Great Britain and Ireland" - thereby recognizing her independence in the letter, but denying it in the spirit and true significance of the title. </p>
