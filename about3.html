      <h4>About John</h4>
      <p>In the early days, major infections were common and often
        required entire families to be quarantined;  the Burke-Gaffneys had their
        share of measles, chickenpox and whooping cough.  John managed to acquire
        scarlet fever when he was about three years of age, and spent the Christmas
        of 1924 in St. Roch's isolation hospital in St. Boniface.  He remembers
        the Christmas tree that had been kept lighted for his return home in mid-January,
        the warm welcome and the beautiful rocking-horse awaiting him.</p>      <p>His progress at St. Ignatius didn't match that of his older
        brothers;  he had to repeat Grade 4 but, like them, he won most of the
        spelling matches and elocution trials.  Like them, he was an altar boy
        and sang in the children's choir.  He took piano lessons from Miss Blythe,
        a spinster neighbor on Jessie Ave., but didn't have the staying-power
        needed.</p>
      <p>John entered St. Paul's High School in 1936, played tackle
        on the football team, and generally grew under the Jesuits' hand.  Years
        later, at Uncle Walter's funeral in Halifax, John's Grade 9 teacher Father
        Pianfetti said, &quot;We used to pass your essays around the common room
        and admire them.&quot;  Alas, John didn't have the same success with mathematics
        and physics.  On a memorable day in Grade 11, Dean of Discipline Father
        MacDonald said, &quot;You must make a choice between writing plays and
        writing exams.&quot;  John chose plays and left the realm of scholarship.</p>
      <p>He worked for the CBC during the war years, where he met
        Elizabeth Jane Sparling   During these years one of his plays, "Night
        Train", was chosen to be broadcast on the CBC National Network, produced
        by the head of the CBC Drama Department, Montreal.  The script for that
        play later appeared in a Department of Education textbook   In his five
        years with the CBC he produced school broadcasts, musical programs and
        national events.   He joined the Winnipeg <em>Tribune</em> in 1946 as a
        reporter.  </p>
      <p>Beth Sparling became a frequent visitor to the Burke-Gaffney
        home, and she was embraced by John's parents.  Beth converted to Catholicism
        and the pair married at St. Ignatius in 1948.  The next year John joined
        the Winnipeg branch of a major Canadian advertising agency.  After having
        been evacuated from their basement apartment in St. Boniface during the
        great flood of May 1950 they later searched for a safer location and bought
        a comfortable old house at 285 Harrow Street, around the corner from St.
        Ignatius School, and spent their spare time for many months repairing
        and improving their home.  Their sons Michael Desmond (1949), Brian Francis
        (1950) and Timothy John (1956) were born in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>In the 1950s John taught a pioneering course on the communication
        of ideas at the University of Manitoba and became a founding member of
        the Manitoba Public Relations Society.  He also joined the St. Ignatius
        School Board, later elected chairman, and became a vice-president of the
        Winnipeg Boy Scouts Association.  He was also invited to the boards of
        Misericordia Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital – an experience that gave
        him a lifelong interest in hospital management. In 1956 he was appointed
        Winnipeg manager of the advertising agency.</p>
      <p>When they learned he was to be transferred to Montreal, the
        little family took an extended train and ferry tour from Winnipeg to Seattle,
        Wash., stopping at choice locations for days at a time – and taking innumerable
        pictures as memoranda.  With great regret, they sold the Harrow Street
        – to a good friend who had admired it – and flew to Montreal at the end
        of December 1959 to take up residence in an apartment building close to
        Loyola College, where the boys attended the adjunct St. Ignatius School.</p>
      <p>They spent two years in Montreal, finding particular pleasure
        in their summer holidays at Lac Raymond in the Laurentian Hills.  Then
        John Labatt Limited, London, Ont., invited him to become the company's
        first director of public relations. They moved into a new house they found
        beside the London golf course on Hunt Club Drive.  The boys entered their
        respective schools and grades, and found new friends.</p>
      <p>Sadly, Beth didn't have much opportunity to enjoy the new
        surroundings.  Her doctor diagnosed cancer of the uterus in 1963.  She
        devoted herself to the three boys but health cast a shadow over these
        years: she was treated for skin cancer in 1965, then, over time, for various
        other manifestations of the disease.  When Mike was accepted to Loyola
        University in 1967, followed the next year by Brian to Saint Mary's University
        in Halifax, John, Beth and Tim moved to an apartment at Centennial Square
        downtown.  Beth died in Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto July 30,
        1981.</p>      <p>John's responsibilities included public affairs, television
        programs and history projects including development of a museum in Queenston,
        Ont., dedicated to Laura Secord, heroine of the War of 1812 as a centennial
        project.  He was the first Canadian to conduct a seminar on public relations
        for the American Management Association in New York, and he served as
        Canadian president of the International Association of Business Communicators.</p>
      <p>In 1970, he helped establish Meadowcrest Centre near London
        dedicated to bring developmentally handicapped adults into the community;
        for which he was honored by the Ontario Ministry of Community Affairs
        in 1984.  He retired from John Labatt  in 1984 to join London's Victoria
        Hospital to organize a major redevelopment project, including a successful
        campaign to raise $10 million toward a new Children's Hospital.  During
        this time he was made an adjunct professor of the University of Western
        Ontario Graduate School of Journalism, lecturing on corporate communication.</p>
      <p>He married Isobel Dix in January 1982.  In 1988, he accepted
        an invitation from Nanaimo Regional General Hospital in British Columbia
        to establish a development program, and retired in Nanaimo in 1990.  He
        helped found the Nanaimo Counsel on Addictions Society and served as a
        director of the Vancouver Island Symphony.</p>
