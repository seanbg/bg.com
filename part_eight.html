<h4>the irish connection</h4>
      <p>We were very conscious of our Irish roots, mostly because
        many of the expatriates visited our home.  Martin Kavanagh, a younger
        man than Dad, a raw-boned teacher of Latin and history, and author, in
        Brandon, would turn up.  Kit, his beautiful wife, had worked for the Irish
        republicans in London and had smuggled messages to Irish prisoners, according
        to Mother.  Their son Kevin became CEO of Great-West Life.  John Shelley,
        a bachelor, chartered accountant, loomed as a &quot;character&quot; from
        the West of Ireland. He was Mary's godfather, so the friendship extended
        over many years;  his booming voice would rattle the windows as he stepped
        through the front door and called, &quot;God bless all here!&quot;.  His
        mother and sisters, Ellie and Rose, lived with him.  Ellie was receptionist
        for Dr. McNulty who tended our health needs and used the dining-room table
        to remove John's tonsils, among his procedures.</p>
      <p>Then there was Frank Gilligan, an Irishman with a young family,
        also a  protegé; he would come to help polish the floors in slow motion; 
        in memory we can still see him scratching his head and saying, &quot;Now
        where the divil did I leave that whisk&quot;.  And another character,
        &quot;Chub&quot; O'Donnell, a maternal relative of Dad's, a permanently
        impoverished confidence man, who, during one bitter winter, used the money
        Dad had given him to buy adequate shoes to buy gifts for us children.</p>
      <p>Many of the Jesuits had Irish roots and they came over regularly
        to play bridge and, Mary testifies, to enjoy Mother's lemon squares. 
        (Mary says, &quot;I have a distinct memory of being under the bridge table
        at Father Fillion's feet.&quot;)  The priests loved getting Mother as
        a partner because she had an uncommon skill at bridge, irritating Dad
        by whistling under her breath as she considered strategy which he considered
        a gross breach of ethics.</p>
      <h4>the empty nest</h4>
      <p>Suddenly it seemed, in the war years, John was the only one
        left at home. Ted was employed as a geologist in northern Manitoba.  
        Des had entered the Jesuit novitiate.  John worked briefly at the Winnipeg
        studio of Radio Station CJGX Yorkton, spent a year at CJRC Winnipeg then
        joined the CBC.  Frank was about to join the Canadian Navy as a signalman; 
        Mary attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart on Westgate Road.  We felt
        the war in small ways:  gasoline and liquor rationing, our first run at
        recycling (residue cooking-fat kept in tin cans), and much rhetoric about
        savings bonds and patriotism.  John had been exempted from military service
        for health reasons.  His broadcasting work brought him in touch with numbers
        of young air-training recruits, mainly from Australia and New Zealand. 
        Mother adopted them, darned their socks and sewed on their wings when
        they graduated.</p>
      <p>In 1939, Patrick and Mary Louise celebrated their 25th wedding
        anniversary as Des graduated from U. of M. and entered the Jesuit novitiate
        at Guelph, Ont. Shortly before he left for Guelph, Des and John joined
        their father to the CNR station to greet Walter Burke-Gaffney S.J., appointed
        to St. Paul's College to teach English and Latin. As they walked along
        the sidewalk to the front door of the old college, Des whispered in John's
        ear, "He's just a squirt, isn't he!"  This of one of Canada's preeminent
        astronomers!</p>
      <p>During the next few years while he was posted to Winnipeg,
        Uncle Walter's presence filled some of the emptiness created by the others. 
        That same year, as president of the Manitoba Council of Professional Engineers,
        Patrick delivered a paper entitled &quot;The Engineer and the Body Politic,&quot;
        a CBC radio broadcast address, published by the Manitoba League for Adult
        Education. </p>
      <p>In 1945 Patrick was elected president of the Dominion Council
        of Professional Engineers, and delivered a paper entitled &quot;The junior
        engineer's place in society&quot; to the graduating engineering students
        of the Maritime Universities, Halifax;  published in the B.C. Engineering
        Society journal. For the 25th anniversary of the journal of the Quebec
        Corporation of Professional Engineers, he wrote a paper entitled &quot;The
        Dominion Council of Professional Engineers:  its origin and functions.&quot;</p>
      <h4>final years </h4>
      <p>In 1947, in a letter to Ted on December 21, Dad wrote: &quot;Mary
        arrived home Thursday in the best of spirits.  She will be 21 on the 19th
        of next month and will graduate in May.  Isn't it appalling -- my baby!!&quot;</p>
      <p>Two events brought great comfort and pride to Patrick and
        Mary Louise in their declining years: in September 1949, Mary entered
        the Society of the Sacred Heart, Albany, N.Y. –  they travelled to Albany
        in 1952 when Mary took her first vows. Also, in 1951, Desmond was ordained
        at the Jesuit Seminary in Toronto and returned home to say his first Mass
        at St. Ignatius with his brothers as acolytes.  We have a set of excellent
        photographs of this occasion, to be found in John's files.</p>
      <p>Dad retired from Johns-Manville in 1953 although he continued
        private consulting with departments of the Federal Government. Towards
        the end of the decade he became increasingly troubled by health problems,
        caused mainly by poor circulation.  Mother rearranged the dining room
        to install a bed so he could avoid climbing the stairs but eventually
        he was admitted to Grey Nuns' St. Vital Centre where he and Mother celebrated
        their Golden Wedding Anniversary surrounded by family including Walter
        Burke-Gaffney S.J., Desmond, Helen and five of her children, and Mary,
        RSCJ..Patrick, 77, died quietly July 16, 1964, in Taché Hospital, St.
        Boniface.  He was buried from St. Ignatius Church which he had helped
        build, with one son celebrating the Mass, his cherished daughter beside
        his widow and the other three sons as pallbearers.  Mother continued living
        at 779 Jessie Ave., keeping the beds ready for any of her children who
        might be passing through, and cheerfully certain she would be rejoined
        in heaven with the man she loved.  She died 13 years later, in 1977.</p>
